# LWE Estimates

Using `lattice-estimator` by Albrecht et al. [1,2], we calculated the bit-security of TLWE with standard deviation of noise denoted by $\alpha$ and dimension denoted by $n$ (assuming 64-bit Torus representation); see the resulting graph below.

The source values are given in `lwe-security-db.yaml` in a form of $(n, -\log(\alpha))$ pairs, the file `lwe-security__n=128-32-2048_mla=8-2-40.dat` serves as a data source for the graph.


### Previous Version: LWE Estimator

Using *LWE Estimator* by Albrecht et al. [3], we calculated the bit-security of TLWE with standard deviation of noise denoted by $\alpha$ and dimension denoted by $n$ (assuming 64-bit Torus representation); see the resulting graph below.

![Graph](__old__lwe-security__n=128-32-2048_mla=8-2-40.png)

The source values are given in `__old__lwe-security-db.yaml` in a form of $(n, -\log(\alpha))$ pairs, the file `__old__lwe-security__n=128-32-2048_mla=8-2-40.dat` serves as a data source for the graph.
